This code will use the Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm to multiply two large matrices. The algorithm will be multithreaded, and run on multiple cores. It may be extended to a distributed compute system.

Utilizes the OpenMP parallel processing library, and the OpenMPI message passing interface.
